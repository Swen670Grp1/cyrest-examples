# Realistic workflows for bioinfomatician

## Introduction

These are the realistic workflow collections for bioinfomatician who want to use Cytoscape programmatically. In these workflows, you can get following things.

* Realistic bioinfomatics usage of cyREST
* Reusable and scalable code as Jupyter Notebook

There are very useful realistic workflows when you want to use Cytoscape from cyREST. The workflows use py2cytoscape and RCy3 that are wrappers for cyREST. In addition to it, this workflos are reusable and scalable, so you can download and change these workflows to what you want.

## Getting started

To start realistic workflows, please do following instruction step by step.

1. Launch Cytoscape.
1. Download or clone [this repository](https://github.com/idekerlab/cyrest-examples) in your local.
1. Go to the directory:"docker" in that repository and make your environment.When you make your environment, please mount the directory that you get in first step. In the following page, there are description how to make your environment with docker.
  * [Overview](https://github.com/idekerlab/cyrest-examples/tree/master/docker)
  * [For R users](https://github.com/idekerlab/cyrest-examples/tree/master/docker/R)
  * [For Python users](https://github.com/idekerlab/cyrest-examples/tree/master/docker/python)
1. Now, you can enjoy this realistic workflow without no error!!


## The contents of each workflow

In each workflow, you can see following contents.

* **README.md** : You should read this first. By reading this document, you can understand overview and what this workflow will do. This document will be helpful for you.
* **R - workflow** : In this workflow, you can use R and RCy3. The contents of process is the same in Python's workflow.
* **Python - workflow** : In this workflow, you can use Python and py2cytoscape. The processing contents is the same in R's workflow.
* **utility** : This directory has the useful utility used in workflows.
* **sampleData** : This directory has data used in workflows.
* **The result of image** : These images show the results of workflow.

So, after reading README.md and understand what this will do, you look R's or Python's Jupyter Notebook.
