# Realistic workflow for bioinfomatician

## Introduction

This is the realistic workflow for bioinfomatician who want to use Cytoscape programmatically. In this workflows, you can get following things.

* Realistic bioinfomatics usage of cyREST
* Reusable and scalable code as Jupyter Notebook

There are very useful when you want to use Cytoscape from cyREST. The workflows use py2cytoscape and RCy3 that are wrappers for cyREST. This workflos are reusable and scalable, so you can change this workflow to what you want.

## The contents of each workflow

In each workflow, you can see following contents.

* README.md : You should read this first. By reading this document, you can understand overview and what this workflow will do. This document will be helpful for you.
* R - workflow : In this workflow, you can use R and RCy3. The contents of process is the same in Python's workflow.
* Python - workflow : In this workflow, you can use Python and py2cytoscape. The processing contents is the same in R's workflow.
* utility : This directory has the useful functions or classes used in workflows.
* sampleData : This directory has data used in workflows.
* The result of image : These images show the results of workflow.

So, after reading README.md and understand what this will do, you look R's or Python's Jupyter Notebook.
