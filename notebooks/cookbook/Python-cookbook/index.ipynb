Apps are available for network and molecular profiling analyses, new layouts, additional file format support, scripting, and connection with databases. They may be developed by anyone using the Cytoscape open API based on Javaâ„¢ technology and App community development is encouraged. Most of the Apps are freely available from Cytoscape App Store.\n",
